# raylib-tictactoe

A super-duper basic Tic-Tac-Toe in all raylib's pure-C glory!

This repo was created as a resource for my tutorial on [Andrew Hamel Codes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETp9EybHuo0AM6tZMzdHxA).

Don't think of this as a game, but instead a minimum-implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. There isn't much code here whatsoever, so expanding it to add some fancy animations, sound effects, networking could be easy! To get this baseline implementation only took ~45 minutes, and to expand it more wouldn't take much. My [Minesweeper](https://github.com/AndrewHamel111/raylib-minesweeper) project was used as a base, as the grid-implementation and some of the Cell-picking logic felt appropriate to reuse for this. The game could easily be modified to support an arbitrary number of rows / columns for the game logic and display, although there must be a reason that non-3x3 tic-tac-toes don't exist..
